# 3-Small-Python-Projects
I made 3 small python projects for practice so I'm publishing them free to modify!

- A clicker game made in tkinter I made to practice python GUI
- A name sorter to learn basic sorting and list inputs
- And a file corruptor to practice with reading and writing files in python because why not ðŸ˜‰

**I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT THE FILE CORRUPTOR MAY CAUSE** <br />
Note that the corruptor will save all contents of the .txt file but into 1 file with .uncorrupted extension (just rename the extension to .txt to view the file)
